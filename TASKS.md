# Home Page Optimization Tasks

1. **Featured Products Redesign**
   - Refine the Featured Products block for better visual alignment with the design reference.
2. **Scalable Featured Products Display**
   - Rethink how Featured Products are presented so the layout scales gracefully when many products are published in the future.
3. **Gene Editing Products Visibility Toggle**
   - Extend the product configuration to include an option that controls whether each Gene Editing product also appears in the home page section.
4. **Services Visibility Toggle**
   - Provide the same “show on home page” option for each Service entry so the home page services list can be curated.
5. **Reagent Section Placeholder**
   - Since the home page currently lacks a dedicated Reagents area, present the corresponding visibility toggle as disabled/greyed out until the section exists.
